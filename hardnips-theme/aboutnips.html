<blockquote>"riff-heavy, post-punk anthems"</blockquote>
<p>Yoko, Saki, Hitomi and The Gooch are four Japanese girls who laugh and yell at each other all the time. The riff-heavy, post-punk anthems of Hard Nips coalesce from jabbing, overdriven guitar and bass lines, big straight beats, and Yoko’s prepubescent straining.</p>
<p>Each of the Nips came to live in New York at different times, from different parts of Japan. And, as conspired by the ever-dextrous hand of fate, they were to cross paths and become fast friends. Yoko ran a Japanese bar/restaurant in Brooklyn which conveniently gave the girls a place to meet, unwind, and escape the English speaking world. They quickly formed a cult-member-like bond whose rituals all included drinking a lot of alcohol and uncontrollably running their mouths in some unintelligible language (some say it was Japanese). The wine flowed like Kool-aid and, somehow, they found themselves buying into the delusion that they were capable of forming a kick-ass rock band. Granted, it’s not exactly a divine revelation for four musicians, but remember, at that point (except Hitomi), none of them were musicians.</p>
<p>End of 2009, it was there that the girls picked up instruments for the first time, and, with all the sonic grace of a crop duster crashing into a pet store, they officially declared themselves a band. They played for months with no intention of ever performing live, they just had a lot of fun getting together, hanging out and making noise, sometimes even attempting to not sound like shit. Then a strange thing happened: somewhere in the collective mind of the band, music was being heard, music that they did not have the ability to play, but very badly wanted to.</p>
<p>Hard Nips have released 2 albums, one vinyl and “Fortune cookie MP3” (you can eat the cookie!). Latest EP is “Uncommon Animal” (July 2014). Hitomi joined Hard Nips as a new drummer in late 2012, Saki also joined replacing Mariko (on guitar) in Sep 2013. Ai joined as keyboard and vocal on Aug 2014. Now it&#8217;s 5 piece. and it has drawn increasing attention via their colorful and kinetic live performances.</p>
